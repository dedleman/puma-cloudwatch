# Puma Cloudwatch Plugin

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/puma-cloudwatch.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/puma-cloudwatch)

[![BoltOps Badge](https://img.boltops.com/boltops/badges/boltops-badge.png)](https://www.boltops.com)

A [puma](https://puma.io) plugin that sends puma stats to CloudWatch.

## Usage

**Important**: To enable the plugin to send metrics to CloudWatch you must set the `PUMA_CLOUDWATCH_ENABLED` env variable. This allows you to send only metrics on configured servers and not unintentionally send them locally.

It also strongly encourage to set the `PUMA_CLOUDWATCH_DIMENSION_VALUE` env variable to include your application name. For example, if your application is named "demo-web", this would be a good value to use:

    PUMA_CLOUDWATCH_DIMENSION_VALUE=demo-web-puma

Then you can get metrics for your `demo-web-puma` app. List of metrics:

* pool_capacity: the number of requests that the server is capable of taking right now.
* max_threads:  preconfigured maximum number of worker threads.
* running: the number of running threads (spawned threads) for any Puma worker.
* backlog: the number of connections in that worker's "todo" set waiting for a worker thread.

The `pool_capacity` metric is important. It can be used to show how busy the server is getting before it reaches capacity.  The formula is:

    busy_percent = ( 1 - pool_capacity / max_threads ) * 100

### Environment Variables

The plugin's settings can be controlled with environmental variables:

Env Var | Description | Default Value
--- | --- | ---
PUMA\_CLOUDWATCH\_DEBUG | When set, the plugin prints out the metrics that get sent to CloudWatch. | (unset)
PUMA\_CLOUDWATCH\_DIMENSION\_NAME | CloudWatch metric dimension name | App
PUMA\_CLOUDWATCH\_DIMENSION\_VALUE | CloudWatch metric dimension value | puma
PUMA\_CLOUDWATCH\_ENABLED | Enables sending of the data to CloudWatch. | (unset)
PUMA\_CLOUDWATCH\_FREQUENCY | How often to send data to CloudWatch in seconds. | 60
PUMA\_CLOUDWATCH\_NAMESPACE | CloudWatch metric namespace | WebServer
PUMA\_CLOUDWATCH\_MUTE\_START\_MESSAGE | Mutes the "puma-cloudwatch plugin" startup message | (unset)

### Sum and Frequency Normalization

If you leave the `PUMA_CLOUDWATCH_FREQUENCY` at its default of 60 seconds and graph out the `pool_capacity` capacity with a 1-minute period resolution, then the CloudWatch Sum statistic is "normalized" and useful. It shows the overall capacity total of the `demo-web-puma` servers.  Particularly, the `pool_capacity` shows available capacity,  and  `pool_threads` shows the total threads configured.

If you change the CloudWatch send frequency, then Sum statistic must be normalized by changing the period on the chart.  For example, let's say you use `PUMA_CLOUDWATCH_FREQUENCY=30`. Then puma-cloudwatch will send data every 30s. However, if the chart is still using a 1-minute period, then the Sum statistic would "double".  Capacity has not doubled, puma-cloudwatch is just sending twice as much data for that period.  To normalize the Sum, set the time period resolution to match the frequency. In this case: 30 seconds.

If you use the Average statistic, then you don't have to worry about normalizing. Average is inherently normalized.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'puma-cloudwatch'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

In your `config/puma.rb`

Add these 2 lines your `config/puma.rb`:

```ruby
activate_control_app
plugin :cloudwatch
```

It activates the puma control rack application to listen on unix domain socket in a default temp directory by default, and enables the puma-cloudwatch plugin to send metrics.

If you run puma like this `puma --control-url 'tcp://127.0.0.1:9293' --control-token abc123` then leave out activate_control_app:
```ruby
plugin :cloudwatch
```

You could instead specify the control url and control token in your `config/puma.rb` like this:
```ruby
activate_control_app 'tcp://127.0.0.1:9293', auth_token: 'abc123'
plugin :cloudwatch
```

### More Setup Notes

Make sure that EC2 instance running the puma server has IAM permission to publish to CloudWatch. If you are using ECS, the default permissions for the ECS task should work.

If are you using ECS awsvpc, make sure you have the task running on private subnets with a NAT. From the AWS docs: [Task Networking with the awsvpc Network Mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html)

> The awsvpc network mode does not provide task ENIs with public IP addresses for tasks that use the EC2 launch type. To access the internet, tasks that use the EC2 launch type must be launched in a private subnet that is configured to use a NAT gateway.
